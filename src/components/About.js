                    <p>
                        Hi, My name is Gabriel and  I am a software engineer with a strong interest in speech technologies, computational linguistics, and solution-based problem solving. As a former Fulbright Scholar and a former educator, future employers can expect me to be an excellent team player, with a drive to continuously learn new technologies thatâ€™ll best serve the project/team at hand. My technical skills combined with my professional and educational backgrounds make me an ideal candidate for any team searching for a quick starter, a self motivator, and a boundary pusher.

                    </p>
